# pyWordle
No I don't play wordle. Yes I reimplemented it in python for funsies based on my best friend's obsession with it and spinoff games. :^)

There's a few bugs I have to work out based on input from said friend and my lack of knowledge of wordle as a game, but here's a start. Commented lightly, hopefully most of the stuff I didn't comment yet seems boilerplate enough.

Depends pysimplegui, I've included the current latest version here which I hope? Is allowed for a cc0 licensed project? If anybody knows if I have to relicense please let me know.
