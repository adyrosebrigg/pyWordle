# pyWordle
No I don't play wordle. Yes I reimplemented it in python for funsies based on my best friend's obsession with it and spinoff games. :^)

There's a few bugs I have to work out based on input from said friend and my lack of knowledge of wordle as a game, but here's a start. Commented lightly, hopefully most of the stuff I didn't comment yet seems boilerplate enough.

Depends `pysimplegui`, which I've included here under LGPL3. `guesses` and `words` taken from the official Wordle site and are accordingly copyright Josh Wardle. All other code is mine and licensed cc0.
